    "A **comment** is a line of code that starts with # and is ignored by the program. Its purpose is to provide developers with a human-friendly explanation of the code nearby.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **import** is a method to use libraries/ packages of code that are not currently available. This allows a developer to use functions from that library within that code. It is possible to import functions from another file a developer has made within a separate file. When importing, a developer has the option to import the entire library (import datetime) or import specific objects or functions from it (from datetime import date).\n",
    "- Example Imports and Functions:\n",
    "    - import datetime\n",
    "        - Function: datetime.date.today()\n",
    "    - from datetime import date\n",
    "        - Function: date.today()\n",

    "A **variable** is a placeholder for a value. The name of a variable can be anything that does not start with a number. A variable has to be assigned before it is used and can be reassigned multiple times.\n",
    "- Valid Variable Names:\n",
    "    - firstName\n",
    "    - first_name\n",
    "    - FirstName\n",
    "    - file1\n",
    "    - file_1\n",
    "- Valid Variable Datatypes:\n",
    "    - string\n",

    "### Datatypes\n",
    "A **string** is a value that is normally seen as text. It is common to display multiple variables in a single string. Therefore, string addition may be needed, where the string version of a variable is added (+) to another string. Additionally, it is possible to format the string by using special characters such as new line or tab. Another method of formatting a string is using triple quotes \"\"\" \"\"\" to diplay the string exactly how it is shown in the code. This method is not recommended since it is not tranferrable to other programming languages. A favored method of displaying variables in strings is called the f-string which allows variables to be mentioned without breaking up the string and avoiding string addition.\n",
    "- String Addition Example:\n",
    "    - message = \"Hello \" + name + \"! I see you are \" + str(age) + \", great to meet you!\"\n",
    "    - Since age is an int and not a string, it needs to be cast to a string by using str()\n",
    "- String Special Characters:\n",
    "    - \\\\' will display a single quote\n",
    "    - \\\\\\ will display a backslash\n",
    "    - \\n will display a new line\t\n",
    "    - \\t will display a tab\n",
    "- f-string Example:\n",
    "    - message = f\"Hello {name}! I see you are {str(age)}, great to meet you!\"\n",
    "    - Note the f in front of the double quotes and the curly brackets around the variable names.\n",
    "- Common String Functions:\n",
    "    - str(value) transforms the value into a string (if possible)\n",
    "    - exampleString.upper() returns the value into all upper-case\n",
    "    - exampleString.lower() returns the value into all lower-case\n",
    "    - exampleString.capitalize() returns the first value into upper-case and the rest into lower-case\n",
    "    - exampleString.count(\"x\") returns the value into all upper-case\n",
    "    - exampleString.replace(\"hello\", \"\") returns the value with all values matching the first input replaced with the second\n",
    "    - exampleString[2] returns the character in the index specified, in this case, 2nd index\n",
    "        - Remember that the first character is the 0th index and index just means location\n",
    "    - exampleString[-1] returns the character in the last index\n",
    "\n",
    "An **int** is a number.\n",
    "- Common Integer Functions:\n",
    "    - int(value) transforms the value into an int (if possible)\n",
    "        - raises an exception if an invalid value was provided i.e. words\n",
    "\n",
    "An **float** is a number with a decimal place. It is possible to limit the number of decimal places shown in a string by using special formatting (this is called precision). To use precision, utilize floatVariable:.Xf where X is the number of decimal places desired.\n",
    "- Common Float Functions:\n",
    "    - float(value) transforms the value into an float (if possible)\n",
    "        - raises an exception if an invalid value was provided i.e. words\n",
    "- Precision Example\n",
    "    - my_float = 3.15\n",
    "    - message = str(f\"My float is {my_float:.5f}\")\n",
    "        - message will be equal to \"My float is 3.15000\"\n",

    "#### Python Collections (Arrays)\n",
    "- There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:\n",
    "    - A **List** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.\n",
    "        - More information can be found in the file [Lists](04-Lists.ipynb)\n",
    "    - A **Dictionary** is a collection which is ordered and changeable. No duplicate members.\n",
    "        - More information can be found in the file [Dictionaries](05-Dictionaries.ipynb)\n",
    "    - A **Tuple** is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.\n",
    "    - A **Set** is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Imported and Custom Objects\n",
    "An example of an imported object/ class is the **datetime** object.\n",
    "- Common DateTime Functions:\n",
    "    - today = datetime.datetime.now()\n",
    "        - today will contain the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and the microsecond.\n",
    "        - today.year will return the year\n",
    "        - today.month will return the month\n",
    "        - today.day will return the day\n",
    "        - etc.\n",
    "    - To create a datetime object, the datetime() class requires three parameters to create a date: year, month, day.\n",
    "        - date = datetime.datetime(2022, 11, 18)\n",
    "        - The datetime() class also takes parameters for time and timezone (hour, minute, second, microsecond, tzone), but they are optional, and has a default value of 0, (None for timezone).\n",
    "    - The datetime object has a method for formatting date objects into readable strings. The method is called strftime(), and takes one parameter, format, to specify the format of the returned string\n",
    "    - The datetime object has a method for formatting strings into datetime objects. The method is called strptime(), and takes two parameters, the string and the format, to specify the format of the date string.\n",
